Build a ruby on rails application to manage your music album collection using test-driven development.
It should be possible to create a user account, to sign in and out and as a user to search your own albums.
For the albums users can upload covers which can be displayed in different sizes.
The implementation code should be so DRY, restful and resource-oriented and well-tested that documentation is not needed.
For testing we strongly recommend using rspec and either cucumber or steak/rspec request specs
